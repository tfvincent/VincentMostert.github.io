									<h1>Startup Challenge<br />
									DoGood</h1>
									<p>In this project I started up a company following 3 UN SDG's. 
										The company bridges the gap between volunteering seekers and volunteering organizations. 
										This would introduce more volunteering opportunities as well as a new look into the activities.</p>
								</header>

								<h2>Introduction and Idea</h2>
								<p>We believe that everybody deserves to be helped and have equal access to it. 
									With over 10% of the people and 1 out of 8 children in this country living in hunger, something needs to be done. 
									There is a major opportunity waiting for us which is the volunteering industry with over 5 million volunteers per week and over a million teachers that teach to those that cannot afford school.
									Imagine a world where access to help is at the swipe of a picture. 
									Let us present the first productive tinder, tinder for volunteering: DoGood. 
									An easy, user friendly app that allows you to manage, increase, and boost your volunteering experience. 
									With this centralized volunteering app, you not only can find the volunteering app in a matter of seconds, you also get the required information and qualifications right there on your screen. 
									No more doubts about where to go, or how to find the right opportunity that fits you best.

								</p>
								<h2>Business Model</h2>
								<p> We are a B2B and B2C Business mainly because we target both companies and volunteers.
									One of our major unique value propositions is that we are a free to use app that looks and works like tinder, thatâ€™s how we set ourselves apart from the competition.
									We will measure our success by different national rates like the US volunteering Rate.
									We will channel our product through the app store and google play store. 
									Our operations, we have 4 main divisions. Most of our costs are going to go to app development and app maintenance with 70 percent of our budget.
									The other two are very low because of the automation and third party marketing resources.

									
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/businessmodel.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Target Market</h2>
								<p>For our market, our first target will be college and high school students who want to have more volunteering opportunities to give them different hours to put on their resume. 
									We also want to focus on people who are retired, because they have a lot of free time and have an opportunity to do good for their community. 
									Thirdly, we want to focus on people with burnouts and depression who suffer from frustrations, hopelessness, and loss of motivations so we can help them reduce stress and spend time doing service for others. 
									This will give them a source of meaning and more of a purpose in life which is why we are targeting them. 
									Lastly, as we look more into the future, we want to eventually end up going global with our app so we can aid people around the world.
