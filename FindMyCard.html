									<h1>Startup Challenge<br />
									FindMyCard</h1>
									<p>In this project I started up a company to find any credit card when one loses it or when it gets stolen. This IoT card uses state-of-the-art technology to track down the location and other types of data of said card. This challenge was done within 7 weeks and presented in front of a jury.</p>

								<h2>Introduction and Idea</h2>
								<p>There is a major issue in this world, credit cards seem to disappear. 
									The average american has 4 credit or debit cards, which means that there are currently around 1.25 billion of those cards present in this beautiful country. 
									However, 1 in 6 people lose their cards every, single, year. 
									This internet of things card is equipped with a paper thin tracker with a seamless finish to it, allowing you to be in control of your money. 
									Via continuous encrypted data transfers, the location of your precious card will never be lost in the matrix again. 
									The service we provide can be split into two strategies. Locate and prevent. We prevent you from losing your card before it is too late, by sending a notification to your phone when the distance between your phone and card is greater than 50 feet. 
									This allows you to temporarily lock your card through the app. 
									Locate will show you the location of your card down to a 3 feet radius. 
									Now how does this technology work? By continuously transmitting geolocation data to the wiliot cloud database, in a secure, encrypted manner, your data is not only safe but secured. 
									To retrieve the location, the only thing you need is a cellular signal. You will have access to the williot cloud, and weâ€™ll make it appear on your device. With the vast growth in cellular technology, you will be able to get the location of your card at any place, at any time. 
								</p>
								<h2>Supply Chain</h2>
								<p> The idea is to connect two manufacturers and for the company to act as the middleman.
									By leveraging the already made credit cards from Mastercard and Visa, we can combine them with Williot's technology while still maintaining a profit.
									These technologies will be shipped to local warehouses to be manufactured into the IoT card that we sell. 
									Once we have the finished product, we ship them to our banking customers.
								</p>

								<h2>Business Model and Customer Base</h2>
								<p>Since we are a B2B business our main customers are banks and we will be targeting the small regional banks such as the eastern cambridge bank or the citizens bank in order to make sure that our idea will actually work and then in the near future we are aiming to expand by targeting the bigger banks such as Bank of America or chase. 
									The consumer would be people like you, me and traditional families. This, because families tend to have more credit cards and they open accounts for their kids.
									Our product will trigger both the frustrations and motivations of our customers by drastically reducing the amount of money they end up losing due to fraud. According to Yahoo finance, for every dollar spent in fraud, the financial institutions have to pay $4 in order to solve the problem (all expenses).
